# Build a blog using Nest.js, Vue.js and MongoDB

Application repo for a simple blog application built with Nest.js, Vue.js and MongoDB.

## Getting Started
This prototype is divided into two separate sections. Namely the Backend ( Built with Nest.js) and the frontend
( Built with Vue.js ).

### Clone the repository
To easily set up the application, clone this repository which contains directory for both sections of the project ( i.e `blog-backend` and `blog-frontend`)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/serguzz/nestjs-vuejs-blog.git
```

## Change directory into the newly cloned project
```bash
cd nestjs-vuejs-blog
```

## Backend
### Change directory into the backend
```bash
cd blog-backend
```

### Install backend dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### MongoDB
Ensure that you have mongoDB installed on your machine before running the application. I have this fully setup on my mac already.

Start mongoDB:

```bash
sudo mongod
```

### Run the application
Open another terminal and still within the `blog-backend` project directory run the application with:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

This will start the backend application on port `3000`.

## Frontend
Open another terminal from the `nest-vue-project` and navigate to the `blog-frontend` folder to setup the frontend

### Frontend dependencies
```bash
cd blog-frontend
npm install
```

### Run the frontend app

```bash
npm run serve
```

### Test the application
Finally open your browser and view the application on http://localhost:8080
